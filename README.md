# News Crawler

## Description
Welcome to News Crawler. News Crawler is an application that allows users to view news sources from aroud the world in an easy manner created by Michael Moreno, Eric Hochwald, and Taeyong Lee. In developing our application we decided to render current news articles using third-party APIs. We were inspired to create News Crawler to give users access to various forms of news articles that could be displayed in different languages from around the world. We also drew inspiration from the fact that some users might want to view their news from other sources that don't include social media. News Crawler was developed using HTML, Javascript, and Bulma. We decided to use Bulma, a CSS library, to create a layout that allowed for an easy UI experience. Certain elements within our HTML were linked to the Bulma documentation that created buttons, columns, selectors, and headers.

The news API that we used was a free-to-use data source, which means that some of the news articles were not the best quality, nor did all of them have images. We thought about using a different API that would give us access to more high quality articles but the price to use it was farily steep. Perhaps, if we were to get funding, we could decide to implement the better news API. In the future, we also hope to implement a feature that translates the content of the news article title and description into another language that the user specifies. This was one of our original user stores, but we decided against it because the API returned weird and out of place characters that would make it difficult to translate.
